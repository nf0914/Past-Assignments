 * Lab #1 Problem 2
 * 
 * 2. 
 * It is a good idea to commit as many errors as you can think of, so that you see what error messages the compiler produces.
 * Sometimes the compiler tells you exactly what is wrong, and all you have to do is fix it.
 * But sometimes the error messages are misleading. Over time you will develop a sense for when you can trust the compiler 
 * and when you have to figure things out yourself.
 * Starting with the Hello World program from the book, 
 * try out each of the following errors. After you make each change, compile the program, read the error message (if there is one), 
 * and then fix the error.
 * Remove one of the opening curly braces.
 * Remove one of the closing curly braces.
 * Instead of main, write mian.
 * Remove the word static.
 * Remove the word public.
 * Remove the word System.
 * Replace println with Println.
 * Replace println with print.
 * Delete one parenthesis.
 * Add an extra parenthesis.
