 * Lab #3 Problem 1
 * 1. To determine the focal length of a camera lens, you use this
 * formula:
 * 1 / f  = 1 / do + 1 / di
 * Where do is the distance from the object to the lens and 
 * di is the distance from the lens to the cameraâ€™s image sensor.
 * Write a program that implements a method named reciprocal, which takes
 * a double x as its parameter and returns 1.0 / x (the reciprocal).
 * The main method will
 * - ask the user for the distance to the object in meters, and the distance to the image sensor in centimeters
 * - calculate and display the focal length in millimeters.
 * Use the reciprocal method in your calculation. Remember to do the unit conversion so that both distances
 * are in millimeters (mm). There are 1000 mm in a meter and 10 mm in a centimeter.
 * Here is what the program output might look like:
 * Enter distance from object to lens in meters: 3.8
 * Enter distance from lens to image sensor in cm: 9.5
 * The focal length is 92.68 mm.
